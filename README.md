<p align="left">
    This repo is a clone of my dissertation, which was submitted to the University of Liverpool 
    as required for my Masters in Computer Science.  Within it, a tactile-based-sensor (GelSight)
    is simulated and appeneded to UR5 arm within a Mujoco environment.  Mujoco, is a physics based 
    engine, which was utilised to train a deep reinforcement learning agent in similar environments
    found in OpenAi's gym.
