<h1 align="left">OpenAI Test-Bed of Contact Based Grasping for Reinforcement Learning</h1>

<h3 align="left">Project Description</h3>
<p align="left">
    This repo is a clone of my dissertation, which was submitted to the University of Liverpool 
    as required for my Masters in Computer Science.  Within it, two optical-tactile-based-sensors (GelSight)
    are simulated and appended to a UR5 arm.  Mujoco is used as the simulation environment - a physics extension to
    OpenAi's gym. This platform was utilised to construct the environments Reach, Push, Slide and PickandPlace
    (similar to those found within gym).  Which in turn act as a test-bed for training a deep reinforcement 
    learning agent using both Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQN) and Hierarchical Double Deep Q-Learning (HDDQN).
